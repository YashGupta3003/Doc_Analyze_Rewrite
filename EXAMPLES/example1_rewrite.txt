A few popular use cases include personalizing your home page banner based on user behavior, localizing website content based on user geography, and testing new page layouts to improve performance.\n\n\nIntegration Essentials\n\n• Make sure you've integrated our web SDK before setting up self-handled campaigns. For more information, see Web SDK Integration.\n• Get MoEngage Web Personalization enabled for your MoEngage account by contacting your Customer Success Manager (CSM) or the MoEngage Support team.\n• Ensure you've handled the default and fallback content to display if personalization fails, or if there are API failures or delays fetching content from MoEngage servers.\n• With Self-Handled campaigns, MoEngage will deliver personalized data to your website. Your website needs to consume this data and handle the display.\n• After displaying the data on your website, send Impression and Click events to MoEngage to calculate campaign performance statistics. For more information, see campaign statistics.\n\nTo contact MoEngage Support, submit a ticket using the Support Web Form in the MoEngage dashboard. For more information, see here.\n\ncampaignTag\n\nEvery Web Personalization Campaign you create in the MoEngage Dashboard has a Campaign Tag, as described in the Campaign Creation guide.  This `campaignTag` helps the MoEngage Web SDK select the correct campaign to fetch personalized content.\n\n`campaignTag` is a parameter of the function you use to fetch personalized data.  Once you call this function, the MoEngage SDK will deliver the personalized data to your website.  Your website then needs to consume this data and take action.",
